In this folder, you have to put the resources that are not provided by the git.

For the dataset, download it on Kaggle, with this link :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/data
Then put it in a "resources/dataset" folder

For resumes, take resumes on the Internet or even yours if it's in English. Those resumes need to have readable text (not an image resume) in a pdf format.
Put those resumes in the "resources/resumes" folder.

In the end the resources folder would have :

/resources
    /dataset
    /resumes
    /README.md
